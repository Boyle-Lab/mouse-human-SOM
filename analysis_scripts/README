This directory contains scripts used to perform various mouse-human-SOM analyses.
Each subdirectory represents a discrete step in the analysis as presented in the
manuscript, and the set of scripts and commands provided will reproduce the raw 
data, CRM-data associations, and background-data associations.

RAW DATA REQUIREMENTS:
Large source datafiles must be retrieved from their respective primary sources:
(ENCODE, UCSC, dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, EMBL, etc.).
We have made an attemtp to indicate within the README scripts within each directory
when such files are required and how they should be arranged within the directory
tree. If something isn't working, first check that you have retrieved all of the
prerequisite data and supplied the correct locations within the shell scripts (See
"DATA LOCATIONS")!

DATA LOCATIONS:
Many of the shell scripts contain variables near the top of the script to indicate
the paths to source data files. After retrieving the required source data and before
running the scripts, edit these lines as needed to indicate the correct location of
the source datafiles.

GZIPPED DATA FILES:
For convenience, we have included the gene annotations used in gene expression
analyses. These are compressed to save space and must be decompressed with
gunzip before running any scripts in the gene_expr tree.

PERL MODULE REQUIREMENTS:
The perl modules in perl-lib are required for the perl scripts used in various
analyses. This directory must be added to the perl module search path prior to
running the scripts. Several scripts also require various modules from CPAN,
which must be installed prior to running the scripts. These include:

Getopt::Long
WWW::Mechanize
XML::Simple
