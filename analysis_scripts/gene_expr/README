This folder contains the scripts and gene annotation files needed to recreate the
RNA-seq gene expression datasets. Each subdirectory (kallisto and batch_norm)
contains a complete set of scripts to generate the applicable data type:

kallisto: do_kallisto_sleuth.sh
batch_norm: do_bnorm-expr.sh

Assuming all dependencies are installed in their default locations, these
can be run on their own to recreate the gene expression source data used
in all publishes analyses.

Before running these, the ENCODE_data directory must be created and
populated with fastq and/or bam files from ENCODE:

mkdir -pv ENCODE_data/{hg19/{GM12878,K562},mm9/{CH12,MEL}}
# ...now retrieve data from ENCODE into the appropriate
# subdirectories

# kallisto also requires genomic fasta files for each
# species. These can be obtained from UCSC. You will need to
# edit do_kallisto_sleuth.sh so the "FASTA_DIR" variable points to
# the correct location for these files.
