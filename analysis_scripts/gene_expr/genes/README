# Human-mouse 1:1 orthologous genes were extracted from the modencode
# common orthologs list (available at http://compbio.mit.edu/modencode/orthologs/modencode.common.orth.txt.gz)
# with the following command:
awk '{if ($2 == "human" && $3 == "mouse" && $6 == 1 && $7 == 1) print $0}' modencode.common.orth.txt > hg19-mm9.1-1-orthologs.txt
